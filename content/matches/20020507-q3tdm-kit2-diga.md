From KIT2 website (by Rigor):

> Darkside vs Digital Annihilation
> Darkside and Digital Annihilation had the honors of being the first game of the season. Most were speculating that DigA would be able to put up a good fight, but in the end, the power of the Darkside would get to them, and man did D|S prove just that. The DigA lineup, which was pretty different than the nicely coming along lineup they had growing earlier this year, took a 100+ frag beating on pro-q3dm6, a nearly 100 frag  loss on ospdm6, and then another 100+ frag stomping again on pro-q3dm6 again, where D|S managed to hit just over 90% frags. The D|S players, as usual, looked great on their teamwork and aim.
