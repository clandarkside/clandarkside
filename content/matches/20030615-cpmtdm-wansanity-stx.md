Playoffs Round 2

o|-<'ss Lineup: UNKNOWN
D|S's Lineup: apheleon, Syn, mahmood, cha0ticz, Alias, reflux

Our revenge match - with mood in the lineup - never happened this time around as the admins wanted to force us to play on a west coast server for an east vs east coast match for 1 player. It's a shame we were forced to forfeit this match as stickmen go on to lose to AoP who lost to us quite handily in the regular season.

Overall the WANsanity league was fun to play in for 2 reasons:
1.) Swiss style matches made it fun after week 1
2.) CPM TDM - nothing beats CPM TDM, period. It's by far the best Team DM implementation out there with a proper focus on teamwork over raw aim.
