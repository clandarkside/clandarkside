From KIT2 website (by Methos):

> KIT East Finals: Yesterday, the KIT east finals played out in amazing fashion. The best of 5 series between Darkside and Kung Fu Clan went down to the wire in a manner that could only be described as amazing. Saying that Darkside won over kfc, 3 games to 2, does not justify the intensity of the matches that took place.
> 
> For obvious reasons, yesterday's games reminded me of the Stickmen and clan Kapitol games from last season's east final. If you think about it, the DS & kfc were probably better played, however, the stx-ck games just ended in more of a dramatic fashion. Having said that, there was no lack of drama in this season's east finals. Congratulations to both clans for the great games.
